# Starbucks-Customer-Satisfaction-Business-Intelligence-Dashboard

Project Title: Starbucks Customer Satisfaction & Business Intelligence Dashboard

Project Description:
I developed a comprehensive data visualization and diagnostic analysis project for a client focusing on Starbucks' customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project involved cleaning raw survey data, performing statistical diagnostic analysis, and designing an interactive Power BI dashboard to identify key drivers of customer loyalty and business growth.

Key Deliverables & Analysis:
Interactive Power BI Dashboard:

Demographic Profiling: Visualized customer segments by age, gender, occupation, and annual income. For instance, I identified that the majority of customers (70%) fall within the 20-29 age bracket.

Behavioral Insights: Mapped customer purchasing patterns, identifying "Coffee" as the top purchase and social media as the primary promotional source.

Customer Experience Metrics: Developed visual ratings for service quality, ambiance, price perception, and WiFi quality to pinpoint areas for improvement.

Diagnostic Data Analysis:

Correlation Studies: Performed statistical analysis to find relationships between variables. I discovered a strong positive correlation (r=0.60) between Ambiance and Service Quality, suggesting that these two factors are the primary drivers of the customer experience.

Regression Modeling: Conducted regression analysis to predict the "Business Hangout Likelihood" based on quality, price, and ambiance ratings.

Strategic Recommendations: Provided data-driven advice, such as targeting frequent customers with specialized pricing strategies to increase the likelihood of social and business meetings.

Forward-Looking AI Use Cases:

Beyond current data, I outlined high-impact AI applications, including Customer Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Predictive Supply Chain Optimization to reduce waste and lower operational costs.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:
Data Visualization: Power BI (DAX, Interactive Report Design)
Statistical Analysis: Correlation & Regression Analysis, Hypothesis Testing 
Business Intelligence: Identifying KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) such as Quality, Price, and Service ratings 
Strategic Consulting: Transforming data into actionable business recommendations for customer retention and market penetration
